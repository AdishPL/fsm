The finite state machine is an abstract concept and defines the behavior of dynamic systems as machines with a finite number of states and a finite number of transitions between these states. 

Most of such states are degenerate and must be disallowed on the code level.
Identifying meaningful states and making them explicit by implementing finite state machine is the main way of dealing with degenerate object states.
